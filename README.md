# Premier-League-Data-ML-Analysis

Introduction
The Premier League, based in England, is home to some of the world's top soccer players and clubs, making it a global benchmark for excellence in the sport. As the most-watched league, reaching 920 million homes across 189 countries, its immense popularity generates vast amounts of data from matches, players, teams, and fan engagement. These datasets provide a unique opportunity for data scientists to analyze trends, optimize performance, predict outcomes, and even uncover insights into the league's influence on global culture and commerce.

The aim of this project is to analyze the past team standings and goals for different teams from the years 1993 - 2025 in the Premier League to identify future winners and related information of the matchups for the upcoming season. This will be conducted through undergoing the full data science pipeline and lifecycle from data curation, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and determining valuable insights and visualizations as such. Combining the past team standings and goals together and conducting an analysis allows us to discover the overall winner of the league and key insights on Premier League data. Besides the winner projections, we can further analyze the goals scored, along with the shot percentages from player shooting stats. This analysis is important as it can help identify common trends, aiding teams in optimizing their performance for upcoming seasons. Additionally, from the perspective of soccer/football fans, the analysis will provide a better understanding of common behaviors in the Premier League, leading to a better viewing experience overall.

"Premier-League-Data-ML-Analysis" is an ipynb file with the cumulation of all of the analysis and work and final results.

"pl-tables-1993-2024 .csv" and "premier-league-matches.csv" are both datasets used in the analysis.
